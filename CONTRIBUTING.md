# Project overview
This project was created as part of the 2024 COIL program between Universidade da Coruña (UDC) and Seneca Polytechnic.

## Purpose and goals
The purpose of this project is to familiarize students in this COIL program with the software development and documentation process under an Agile environment. This experience is designed to be as close to industry expectations as possible and offers students a chance to work collaboratively through language and cultural differences.

The goal of this project is to create a software tool capable of creating and working with linear regression models through a user-friendly interface. By presenting a way to easily build, save, and apply linear regression models, users can generate more accurate predictions across multiple data sets. Read [Linear regression in this project](#linear-regression-in-this-project) and [Applications for AI and machine learning](#applications-for-ai-and-machine-learning) to learn more.

## Target audience
This software is intended for anyone interested in generating their own data models. We expect most people using this software tool to have a data set they want to generate models and analyse as part of a larger project.

## System requirements
For best results, users should run the software on Windows 10 and above. Please note that certain tools used in this program is not compatible with operating systems earlier than Windows 8.

## Tools used to build this program
This section covers all the tools used to create the software. This includes the language and libraries. Make sure you have all the software tools downloaded and ready to go before adding to the code.

### Programming language
This software is created using Python 3.13 in a Windows environment. Python is an easily extensible language that includes and supports multiple code libraries. To run and edit the code, we suggest using a code editor such as Visual Studio Code with Python installed.
### Code libraries
All libraries used are Python specific. If you would like to add a library, make sure it is Python compatible beforehand.
- **PyQT5:** a Python bound version of the GUI (graphical user interface) toolkit, Qt. Used to create the user interface.
- **Scikit-learn:** an open-source machine learning library. Used to generate models from the imported data.
- **Pandas:** a data manipulation and analysis library for tables and series. Used to analyse and generate new data.
- **NumPy:** a numerical library that supports mathematical functions. Used to create predictions through linear regression models.
- **Joblib:** a lightweight pipelining library. Used to automatically compress large numerical data files for more efficient processing.

### Project management platforms
These are the platforms used to facilitate communication and keep track of our progress.
- **Discord:** used for general communication everyone can access, including project specific questions and scheduling discussion. Our weekly virtual meetings are also held here.
- **WhatsApp:** used for developer specific communication to send updates on when the code is being edited and uploaded.
- **Microsoft Teams:** used to attend class and share sprint retrospectives.
- **Taiga:** used to track our tasks and progress each week.
- **GitHub:** a repository is used to upload and test the code. The final version of the software along with the documentation are hosted on GitHub.

# Linear regression in this project
In statistics, linear regression is a type of model that shows the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variable with a straight line. This line must have the best fit between all data points, meaning that the differences between the two variables are minimised. It is a key concept in data science that helps to predict the outcomes of new data.

This project is focused on developing a software tool that can both generate and apply linear regression models. By inputting data sets, this software can generate a linear regression model, which can then be saved and applied to a different data set. The outcomes can then be outputted and used for other prediction models.

# Applications for AI and machine learning
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of technology that enables computers to make decisions like humans. Predictive models like linear regression are used to develop AI through a process called machine learning. This process trains computer algorithms with prediction models so the AI can generate its own conclusions from data points. When combined with other predictive tools, this software can be used to generate a machine learning algorithm.

# Our development process
This project was developed using Agile. The Agile methodology is an iterative project management framework that strives for continuous improvement and increased collaboration. Under Agile, we follow a Scrum framework to complete our project goals.

## What is Scrum
The Scrum framework follows the Agile methodology by working through a backlog of product goals set by the product owner in short increments called sprints. During each sprint, team members choose which goals to fulfill from the backlog and hold regular Scrum meetings to ensure everyone is focused and on track. At the end of a sprint, each team member delivers a sprint retrospective to reflect on what went well and what can be improved for the next sprint.

## Sprint details
This project was developed over eight sprints. Each sprint lasted 1 week apart from sprint 4 and sprint 8, which lasted 2 weeks. Because this project is part of a school curriculum, the sprints began either on a Tuesday or Friday based on the student’s class schedule. This team was part of the Tuesday sprint schedule.

## Meeting and retrospective schedule
Each week, the team meets at least two times. Once on Tuesday in class to present the sprint progress and share our sprint retrospective. And once on Friday on Discord as a Scrum meeting to update one another on our task progress.

# Additional project information
This section contains other information about this software, including the team behind its development and our future localisation efforts for this project.

## Meet the team
- **Ana Valls Bendicho:** developer
- **Ainhoa Carnota Angulo:** developer
- **Adrián Tinaquero Vizoso:** developer
- **Noel Pan Brea:** scrum master
- **Han Ting Chen:** documentation writer

## Localisation process
Currently, the software is written in Spanish. However, to encourage more users and developers to access this software, the team has decided to localise the software to English. The developers have already begun translating the doc strings and comments in the code to English so more developers around the world can work on the code.
